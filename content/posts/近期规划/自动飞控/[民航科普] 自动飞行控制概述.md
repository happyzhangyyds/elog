自动飞行控制是指通过飞行自动控制系统操纵舵面和油门杆，自动控制飞机的飞行，这时驾驶员只进行监控，不直接参与对飞机的控制。[2](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%87%AA%E5%8A%A8%E9%A3%9E%E8%A1%8C%E6%8E%A7%E5%88%B6)

Automatic flight control refers to the automatic control of the aircraft's flight through the control of the **control surface** and **throttle** lever through the flight automatic control system. At this time, the pilot only monitors and does not directly participate in the control of the aircraft.

自动飞行控制系统（AFCS）是完成飞行器在各种飞行模态下的控制任务，它是通过控制飞行器的姿态和轨迹来实现的。[3](https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv20333773/)

The Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS) is used to complete the control tasks of aircraft in various flight modes. It is achieved by controlling the attitude and **trajectory** of the aircraft.

自动飞行控制系统包括自动驾驶飞行指引系统（AFDS）和自动油门（A/T）等组成部分，它们可以提供自动稳定、导航、着陆、地形跟随等功能。[2](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%87%AA%E5%8A%A8%E9%A3%9E%E8%A1%8C%E6%8E%A7%E5%88%B6)

The automatic flight control system includes components such as the Automatic Flight Guidance System (AFDS) and the Automatic **Throttle** (A/T), which can provide functions such as automatic stability, navigation, landing, and terrain following.

可以通过这个视频入门——[**1.1 自动飞行控制系统引言**](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV16z4y1s7My/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click&vd_source=237e295a40d7aaea043ead8c0d2c78ab)

You can get started with this video - Introduction to 1.1 Automatic Flight Control System

这门课给我最直观的感受就是以《自动控制原理》这门课为基石做综合运用，里面涉及到很多的自控方面的知识。并且具象到民航飞机上的应用。从一个比较抽象的理论知识到具体的实践应用。
我则关注于这期间的理论是如何转换到实践当中去的。

The most intuitive feeling this course gave me was to use the course "Principles of Automatic Control" as the foundation for comprehensive application, which involves a lot of knowledge in the field of self-control. And concrete application to civil aviation aircraft. From a relatively abstract theoretical knowledge to specific practical applications.

I focused on how the theory during this period was transformed into practice.

刚开始双语授课，有点不习惯，因为存在着很多专业名词的理解问题，而且本身对英语的理解能力至少是低于中文理解能力的 3-5 倍，因为还是刚开始的第一节课，会好一些，但是还是尽可能去加强英语与专业课之间的衔接能力。

At the beginning of bilingual teaching, I feel a bit uncomfortable because there are many problems with understanding professional terms, and my own understanding of English is at least 3-5 times lower than that of Chinese. As it is still the first class, it will be better, but I still try to strengthen the connection between English and professional courses as much as possible.

尽可能去靠近一点知识，并做好整理。

Try to get as close to the knowledge as possible and organize it well.

今天讲的知识和自控联系很深，教学速度偏快，想要理解更好肯定是要花时间的，在教材和 ppt 的帮助下，希望能吸收得更好一些。
还有个趣事就是课堂最后老师要用英语回答一个问题，很显然我们对英语的运用能力远不及母语。

The knowledge and self-control discussed today are deeply related, and the teaching speed is relatively fast. It will definitely take time to understand better. With the help of textbooks and PowerPoint, I hope to absorb them better.

Another interesting thing is that the teacher has to answer a question in English at the end of the class, and it is obvious that our ability to use English is far inferior to our native language.

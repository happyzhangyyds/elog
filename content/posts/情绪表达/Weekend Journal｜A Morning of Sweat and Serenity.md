# ⚜Preface

---

I decided to start this weekend morning with a long, peaceful walk.

- 🕗 **Time:** 8:52 AM
- 🛣️ **Route:** City Park Loop
- 🏃‍♂️ **Distance:** 9.33 km
- ⏱️ **Duration:** 1h 28min
- ❤️ **Average Heart Rate:** 127 bpm
- 💪 **Training Load:** 36.1 (Moderate)

To be honest, I had planned to run 9.33 kilometers from the start.

But in the first 2 kilometers, I just walked, taking my time to look around and enjoy the landscape. The morning air was calm, and everything felt so peaceful that I didn’t want to rush.

However, I knew I had a lot to do later in the day, so for the remaining 7 kilometers, I decided to pick up the pace and run instead of walk.

In the end, I was drenched in sweat, but my mind felt incredibly clear.

Lotus leaves swayed gently in the breeze, with a few pink blossoms blooming quietly. Reflections of distant buildings and cranes danced on the water’s surface—a silent conversation between nature and the city.

# 🧘 Final Thoughts

---

- Every workout is a conversation—with nature, and with myself.
- The flowers, the breeze, the reflections—they all reminded me:**Life doesn’t have to move fast. Sometimes, just walking is enough.**
- The sweat on my skin felt like it was washing away the week’s stress.

Next time, I want to head out even earlier—maybe catch the lotus pond at sunrise. I wonder what it looks like when the blossoms are still asleep, and the world is just beginning to wake.

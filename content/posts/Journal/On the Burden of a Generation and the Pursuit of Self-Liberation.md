Today, I find myself standing at a crossroads — not just personally, but generationally. The world we inherited is no longer the world our parents thrived in. The economic engines that once propelled entire families into prosperity have slowed, sputtered, and in many cases, reversed. The age of exponential growth, globalization, and policy-driven uplift has passed. What remains is a system burdened by debt, over-leverage, and diminishing returns.

We — the so-called “bulls and horses” of this era — are expected to carry the weight of yesterday’s promises while being denied the means to fulfill our own. We are told to endure, to compete, to strive harder in a game where the rules have changed and the rewards have shrunk. But the truth is clear: we are not broken — the system is.

In such a climate, the traditional pursuit of asset-based wealth has lost its relevance. What matters now is the management of liabilities, the preservation of cash flow, and the cultivation of resilience. Every decision must be grounded in necessity, not vanity. Consumption must shift from the demand side to the supply side — from impulse to intention.

An iPhone 13 is sufficient. A secondhand car, if it meets one’s needs, is a rational choice. A NAS server, if it serves a clear purpose, is a valid investment. But anything beyond necessity must be questioned. We can no longer afford to be consumers of illusions.

This realization extends beyond economics. It is spiritual. Emotional. Existential.

Our generation is not only economically burdened — we are emotionally indebted. To our families, who meant well but often misled. To institutions that prioritized conformity over individuality. To relationships that promised connection but delivered confusion. I have carried these weights — guilt, resentment, disillusionment — but I carry them no longer.

I now see that awakening is not a moment — it is a process. A shedding of illusions. A reclaiming of agency.

The only viable investment left is the self. In language — to connect beyond borders. In technology — to remain relevant. In creativity — to generate value where none existed. In understanding — to navigate the chaos with clarity. These are the only assets that cannot be taxed, stolen, or devalued by policy.

I do not seek escape — I seek sovereignty.

I will not be a passive participant in a system that no longer serves me. Whether through strategic migration, skill acquisition, or intellectual reinvention, I will find a path to autonomy. Not to rebel, but to reclaim. Not to abandon, but to transcend.

I do not resent my origins. I am grateful for life, even if I critique the path it began on. I am thankful for the pain — it sharpened my awareness. I honor the love I once gave — it taught me what I value. But I will no longer be bound by inherited expectations or emotional debts.

The next decade must not be spent in regret or resentment. It must be spent in pursuit — of clarity, of competence, of freedom.

I am no longer asleep. I am no longer waiting.

This is the beginning of my true life — authored by choice, not chance.

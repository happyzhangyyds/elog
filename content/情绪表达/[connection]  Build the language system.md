I know that using another language to express my opinions is very difficult. I may not be able to convey my feelings accurately, but we must take this path to improve ourselves.So I wish to do these things, even though they are very difficult.

Language is a tool that allows us to express the consciousness in our minds. If we wish to convey our viewpoints and insights to more people, we need a universal language. At the same time, language also influences our way of thinking and behavioral habits, presenting us with a more inclusive and open world.

We need to confront what we used to fear. Perhaps this is the truly exciting moment that awaits us!
